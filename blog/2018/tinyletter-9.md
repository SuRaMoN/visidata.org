# VisiData Case Study #2: save selected cities from a csv in json format

Hello,

The next installment of the VisiData video series is here!  This time, a member of my co-working space had asked if I could create a bubble map of cities from a few particular counties.

It was pretty straightforward to do this with Google Maps and a bit of Javascript, but then I had to get the location and population data for 50 cities into json format.  Normally this would require a small script and 20 minutes of trial and error, but fortunately, there is VisiData, and I was able to get this done in only a couple of minutes.  Besides being a lot faster, it's also a lot more fun to play with data this way!

So here's the video that explains the process:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0qn8OIiV-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0qn8OIiV-w)

This video shows how to group rows by multiple columns, and then select rows from particular groups, to be saved into a .json file.

If you have a data task that you'd like to do with VisiData, but aren't exactly sure of the best way to do it, send me an email!  There's probably a reasonably easy way to make it happen, and I'd love to help make your data life easier.

Cheers,
