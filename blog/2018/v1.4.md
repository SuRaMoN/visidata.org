# [v1.4](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v1.4) (2018-09-24)

This is largely a bugfix and performance release.  It was originally planned as a patch release (v1.3.2), but some features and interface changes crept in, so it is officially v1.4.

- [pyobj] `visidata.view(obj)` and `visidata.view_pandas(df)`
- [pandas] `-f pandas` loads file using `pandas.read_<ext>()`
- [date] date minus date now gives float number of days instead of seconds
- [vdtui] internal colorizer API changed significantly
- [vdtui] significant idle performance improvement

As usual, a more complete list of changes and features is in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md).

See the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/dev/ROADMAP) for the planned future direction of VisiData.
