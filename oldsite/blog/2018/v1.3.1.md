# [v1.3.1](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v1.3.1) (2018-08-19)

We found some issues with 1.3 (aggregators interacting with nulls/errors, primarily) that we didn't want to let sit until 1.4.  So we fixed those issues and a couple others, and added a few 'minor' features.  This patch version should be a definitive improvement over the base 1.3 version.

The complete list of changes is in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md).  Here are the new options and features:

- new `extend` join type keeps the type of the first sheet, extending it with columns from the other sheets
- `rename-sheet` command (thanks to @jsvine for suggestion; what default keybinding should it have?)
- [DirSheet] add `reload-rows` (`gz^R`) to undo modifications on all selected rows
- remove all options.foo_is_null and add options.null_value
- options.save_errors (default True) to include errors when saving
- add options.json_indent for json pretty-printing
