# PyCon2018 and Video #5

Greetings VisiDaters!

I'm back from PyCon2018, but still recovering, so I'll keep this one short.

First, PyCon happened!  There was no lightning talk this time, but we had both an "Open Space" and a sprint for VisiData, and it was great to engage directly with users.  Several fixes and documentation improvements are in the works because of suggestions we got during these sessions.  Thanks in particular to Rob, John, and Anja for sprinting on a yaml loader and the new rows-[un]select-expr commands, both of which will be available in v1.3.

Second, there's a new Twitter handle in town!  [@VisiData](https://twitter.com/VisiData) ~~(note the underscore)~~ is now the official VisiData account to follow.  I migrated my personal account (and recreated a new personal account), so you won't have to do anything if you're already following me.  But it's a lot clearer now which tweets should go where.

And finally, here's video case study #5, in which I reshape an html table using a bunch of nifty commands, including fill ('f'), melt ('M'), and pivot ('W'): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJ9F4uTkz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJ9F4uTkz8)

Okay, I'm off to sleep off some more jetlag.  Thanks for using VisiData, and as always, feel free to send me an email, I'd love to hear how you're using it!
