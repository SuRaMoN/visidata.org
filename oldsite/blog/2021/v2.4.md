# [v2.4](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.4) (2021-04-11)

This release, hot on the heels of the 2.3 release last week, is primarily to address some bugs that were found in 2.3.
Originally it was slated to be a patch release (2.3.1), but the removal of `options.use_default_colors` with the fix for #939 and the semantics of splitwindow felt sufficient to warrant a minor version bump, and so we tossed the few other improvements that were sitting on the develop branch.

## Improvements

- [color] remove `options.use_default_colors` (thanks @lxcode #939)
    - `options.color_default` can now have both fg and bg
    - other color options which do not specify fg or bg will use the missing component from `color_default`
    - to use terminal default colors, set `options.color_default=""`

- [splitwindow] stabilize sheet stack associations
    - `Shift+Z` pushes 'under sheet' (if any) onto other stack
    - `Shift+Z` does not swap panes anymore
    - `g Tab` changes which stack is in the top vs bottom panes
    - `options.disp_splitwin_pct` cannot be sheet-specific

- [status] show nSelectedRows on rstatus

## Bugfixes

- [pyobj-show-hidden] grab visibility lvl from sheet specific option (thanks @frosencrantz #947)
- [splitwin] prevent flickering-on-full-window
- [splitwin] if top sheet quit, keep bottom sheet in bottom pane

### Loader specific bugfixes

- [gzip] fix progress bar when opening gzip (thanks @geekscrapy #925)
- [http] fix loading files from url without specifying filetype
- [sqlite] use `TABLE_XINFO` for hidden/virtual columns (thanks @dotcs #945)
- [sqlite] reload perf: load without pre-counting rows (which required 2nd full table scan)
- [vds] save typed values instead of formatted display values (thanks @frosencrantz #885)
- [xlsx] stringify "header" row values for column names (thanks @davidwales #921)
