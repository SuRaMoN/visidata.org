# [v0.98](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v0.98)  (2017-11-23)

Title: VisiData v0.98, now with graphs and maps (experimental)

When I announced that v0.97 was "feature complete", I must have been talking about vdtui.
vdtui has been pretty stable, even as VisiData has added a low-resolution pixel canvas
(using Braille unicode characters) to draw graphs and maps.  In fact, apart from a few bug
fixes and small API changes, the only addition to vdtui in v0.98 is basic mouse support.

Here's a list of what's new in VisiData v0.98:

- [visidata.org](http://visidata.org) revamp

- [canvas] graphs and maps!
    - `.` or `g.` to push a graph or a map from the current sheet (dot=plot)
    - supports .shp and vector .mbtiles
    - mouse left-click/drag to set cursor
    - mouse right-click/drag to scroll canvas
    - scrollwheel to zoom in/out on a canvas
    - `s`/`u` to select/unselect rows at canvas cursor
    - `ENTER` to push source sheet with only rows at canvas cursor
    - 1-9 to toggle display of 'layers' (colors)
    - `_` to zoom out to full width
    - `disp_pixel_random` option chooses pixel attrs at random (weighted), instead of most common
    - `+`/`-` to zoom in/out via keyboard

- Updates to commands
    - Remove ` (backtick) command
    - Remove most zscroll commands (`zs`/`ze`)
        - `zz` moves cursor to center, uncertain about the future of `zt` due to conflict with `t` for toggle
    - `ga` adds N new rows
    - `gz=` sets value for selected/all rows to a Python sequence in this column
    - `z_` sets column width to given value
    - `z-` cuts column width in half
    - `P` is now "paste before" (like vim); `R` now pushes a random sample
    - `^Z` now sends SIGSTOP; `^O` "opens" the external $EDITOR (from builtin line editor)
    - [ColumnsSheet] Added `~!@#$` commands back, to set type of source columns
    - `w` is becoming a more universal "visibility toggle"
        - [TextSheet] `w` toggles wordwrap
        - [canvas] `w` toggles display of the labels
        - [pyobj] `w` toggles hidden properties and methods

- Updates to command line args and options
    - set initial row/col with `+<row#>:<col#>` (numeric only)
    - `--delimiter`/`-d ` option (separate from `--csv-delimiter`) sets delimiter for tsv filetype
    - `--replay-wait`/`-w` renamed from `--delay`/`-d`
    - `disp_date_fmt` option for date display format string (default is date-only)
    - `zero_is_null`/`empty_is_null`/`none_is_null`/`false_is_null` set which values are considered null (previously was `aggr_null_filter`)
    - `--skiplines` option renamed to `--skip`, and `--headerlines` to `--header`

- Design improvements
    - Add specific rowtype for each sheet (see right status)
    - dates are a kind of numeric type (useful for graphing as the x-axis)
    - `use_default_colors` (at behest of @wavexx)
    - more robust Progress indicator
    - populate DescribeSheet in async thread
    - remove default names for unnamed columns
    - history up/down in edit widget now feels right

- API changes
    - change main Column API to getter(col, row) and setter(col, row, val)
    - move Path and subclasses out of vdtui
    - TextSheet source is any iterable of strings
    - Sheet.filetype provides default save filename extension
