# [v0.97.1](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v0.97.1) (2017-10-29)

It's VisiData's 1st birthday! I started working on VisiData 1 year ago today (Oct 29).

v0.97.1 has only a few small patches:

- Fixed help manpage on OS/X (man has no --local-file option)
- Fixed Postgres (incomplete lazy import)
- Fixed ENTER on SheetsSheet on SheetsSheet to be no-op
- Fixed readthedocs redirect to visidata.org
