# VisiData's Limits to Growth

I added a page on the website, [/limits](/limits), summarising a list of things we wish were different, but would require unwanted adjustments to the architecture to change.

Something I learned from spending time with Saul is that building software always requires making decisions around trade-offs. Sometimes, the decision about the trade-off really should lie with the user, which is part of the reason we added so many options.

Sometimes, though, to fix it would require a large architectural overhaul, or would involve a trade-off that is just..,Worse in every way. Collecting these stories is what the [limits](/limits) page is for.
