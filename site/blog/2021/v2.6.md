## [v2.6](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.6) (2021-09-19)

### VisiData v2.6: now with menus!

This release introduces a new[0] hierachical menu system for discovering and executing commands.

Press Ctrl+H to open the help menu, arrows and Enter to move around.  Or use the mouse.

Here's a [video demo of this new menu system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QixtGeSbSLU), including a sample workflow within VisiData for finding which commands aren't in the menu (using the mouse almost entirely).

Also in this release are several performance improvements, feature enhancements, and bugfixes.  See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.6/CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

[0] Back in v1.1 (2018), VisiData had an experimental one-line menu system, but it was removed in v1.3 (6 months later), as it wasn't feeling right.
