### VisiData v2.6.1: minor bugfixes!

In preparation for the [VisiData workshop at Strangeloop 2021](https://thestrangeloop.com/2021/introduction-to-visidata.html), this patch was released with several minor bugfixes.

Features with fixes include:

- [sysopen-row](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/1116)
- [fixed-format saver](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/1123)
- DirSheet's copy-files
- [sqlite loader's exception handling](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/1125)

On top of this, we have updated the [homebrew](https://github.com/visidata/homebrew-vd) and [personal debian](https://github.com/visidata/deb-vd) repositories to contain the most recent version of VisiData.

We appreciate everyone who has mentioned VisiData in several threads on HackerNews and reddit, recently. Talking about tools you love in public spaces, means a lot to everyone who dedicates time to work on them.

Happy VisiDating!
