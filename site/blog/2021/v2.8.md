## [v2.7](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.8) (2021-12-16)


### VisiData v2.8: Python 3.10 compatibility

This is a pretty small release of mostly bugfixes, which still has a few changes that merit a minor version bump.

The all-stars of this release are [@ajkerrigan](https://github.com/ajkerrigan) and [@geekscrapy](https://github.com/geekscrapy).

@ajkerrigan [found, debugged, and fixed a Python 3.10 compatibility bug](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/1227). Before v2.8, you could see many warnings related to `COLOR-1` in the status message.

@geekscrapy contributed 7 PRs for v2.8. Thanks to his PRs, VisiData now gracefully skips blank lines in json files, and will not attempt to load plugins which failed to install.


Happy holidays!
