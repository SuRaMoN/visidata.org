## [v2.9](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.9) (2022-08-21)


### VisiData v2.9: Windows, windows, and more windows 

This release has about 6 months of development in it, including many bugfixes, improvements, and a few experimental features. Here are the highlights:

- new confirm dialog window (press y to accept; Enter no longer required)
- new command addcol-window bound to w to create a new column with a list of values "around" the current row
- new formatter attribute on column (and options.disp_formatter) to set the format for both display and text saving. Can be generic, python, json (and it's also extensible)
- support for standard paths for config file and support dirs (XDG and otherwise)
- new loaders for Apache Arrow (IPC and streaming) and parquet formats
- browse remote .zip URLs and extract files from them without downloading the whole archive
- by popular demand, we've decided to invert the default scroll wheel direction! If you liked how it was before, you can set options.scroll_incr = 3
- and a couple things to make it easier for Windows users

There's a lot to love in this release of VisiData; the above is only a partial list. See the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.
