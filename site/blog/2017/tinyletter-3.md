# VisiData v0.98 preview: Graphs

Hello VisiDaters,

I recorded a 5 minute screencast to demo the new graphing functionality that will be out in v0.98 later this month.  Along the way, I show how to use 'A' and 'ga' to make a new sheet from nothing, and '=' to make computed columns. 

Here is the screencast on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Ozap_numsjI](https://youtu.be/Ozap_numsjI)

Let me know if you have any workflows or features you are interested in hearing more about!
