## [v1.5.2](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v1.5.2) (2019-01-12)

We are starting off the New Year with a very small patch for a few bugs.

Briefly,

1. Fixed `g*`
    - thanks to both @jsvine and @layertwo for noticing and notifying us.
2. If suspended during editline (with `Ctrl+Z`), VisiData will now correctly resume in the editline.
3. `Ctrl+W` on an empty value in editline does not error out of the editline.

[And that's it](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md#v152-2019-01-12).

Happy new year, everyone!
