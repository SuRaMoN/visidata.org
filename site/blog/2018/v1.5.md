* [v1.5](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v1.5) (2018-11-02)

For the most part, this is a bugfix release.  A few other improvements are here as well:

1. Basic plugin support 
   - `~/.visidata` added to sys.path on startup
   - copy plugin to e.g. `~/.visidata/vdfoo.py`
   - add `import vdfoo` to `.visidatarc` to activate

2. Error saving
   - for tsv and json, errors are saved as `options.safe_error` string (default `#ERR`)
   - if that option is an empty string, error message is saved instead

3. Mouse improvements
   - click now moves to column also
   - right-click to edit cell, rename column, or rename sheet, depending on where clicked.

4. xls/xlsx loaders now use `options.header` to determine number of rows used to set column names (default is 1).

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md) for a more complete list of bugfixes and changes.
