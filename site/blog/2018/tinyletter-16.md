[originally published as TinyLetter #16]

Hello VisiData enthusiast,

Thanks for signing up for this TinyLetter and for your continued support.  After some reflection I've decided to move these kinds of updates to my Patreon, and I would encourage you to check out the most recent one, which talks about v1.5.1, a forking undo experiment, and saving to sqlite:

If VisiData is your jam then I would also encourage you to subscribe, because there will be some pretty interesting things coming in the next year.  But all posts will be made public, so you don't even have to subscribe in order to stay updated.

Happy new year, and please come join me on Patreon!

Saul
