I have always wanted a home for longform conversations on VisiData.

For the past three years, we have experimented with [tinyletters](/blog/2018/tinyletter-16), [videos](/blog/2018/tinyletter-13), [release notes](/blog/2019/v1.5.2), [podcast interviews](/blog/2019/python-init), [patreon posts](https://www.patreon.com/saulpw), [twitter threads](https://twitter.com/VisiData/status/1112474267013120001), and [responses to github issues](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues/275).

I now want to consolidate those conversations into a single place. The backfill of this blog hopes to accomplish this. Additionally, I wanted a space for writing that is more impulsive than a newsletter, and merits more room for thought than a tweet. I am hoping this blog will become that space.

Thanks for sticking around for the past 3 years. =) Welcome to the next stage in this experiment.
