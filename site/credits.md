## Author

My name is [Saul Pwanson](https://www.saul.pw) and I'm a [software engineer](https://saul.pw/resume) and [amateur data sleuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aHfK8EUIzg). I live in Seattle but the terminal is my home.

I am a founding member of the [Devottys](https://bluebird.sh), and we're building an ecosystem of data-oriented textpunk powertools.
If you like what we're doing, [send me an email](mailto:vd@saul.pw) or subscribe to my Patreon:
