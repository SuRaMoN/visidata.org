## What is VisiData?

VisiData is an open source multitool for data exploration and manipulation.
It combines the clarity of a spreadsheet, the efficiency of the terminal, and the power of Python, into a lightweight utility which can handle millions of rows with ease.

## Who wrote it?

My name is [Saul Pwanson](http://saul.pw) and I've worked as a software developer for over 20 years.
I live in Seattle but the terminal is my home.

## What inspired VisiData?

As a data worker, I frequently want to take a quick peek at some raw data, to check something out, or to get a feel for what's there.

I usually managed to get what I needed with a combination of UNIX utilities and ad-hoc Python scripts.
But it was a real slog sometimes, and my wrists were starting to hurt.

So at the end of 2016, I decided to take a personal sabbatical and use my experience with data to create a useful tool.
One that could be used in any terminal, with any data source, with minimal requirements and zero configuration.
The result is VisiData.
